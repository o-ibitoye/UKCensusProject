# UKCensusProject
This Project examines the census of a town of moderate size to suggest investments in future services and identify potential use cases for an unused plot of land. To make these recommendations, the census data was first cleaned to correct any errors or missing records.

## Insights

### Development
The data indicates that the town has a significant Christian population and a large number of commuters. Hence, building a train station would not benefit the majority of the people. In the near future, immigrants moving to the town may require low-density housing, which could result in an increase in the town's population. 

The population of the town has a high life expectancy and a low incidence of disability, suggesting that they are expected to live longer. However, this trend may not continue as the population ages. Therefore, it is essential to consider investing in medical services to cater to their needs.

The town's population has not grown significantly over the years. Therefore, services like high-density buildings and train stations are not currently needed. Instead, low-density housing and medical services could attract more residents to the area in the long run, given the population's relatively high life expectancy. 

The town has a sizeable Christian population, and it would be appropriate for the government to build a church on the vacant land.


### Investment
As the number of retirees is projected to increase in the upcoming years, coupled with a low unemployment rate and a lack of school-aged children, it is clear that the town's demographic landscape is changing. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population consists of married couples, suggesting the possibility of family expansion and an increase in the number of children required to attend school as per UK law. Children must start full-time education when they reach the age of five. Given these factors, it would be a wise investment decision to allocate resources towards establishing a facility for end-of-life care to cater to the ageing population. 

Building a facility for end-of-life care would align with the town's shifting demographic patterns and address the growing need for elderly care.
